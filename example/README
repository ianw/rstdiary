This is a fairly complete example of keeping a diary

Simply type "make" and a virtualenv with rstdiary is created (if
required) and the diary output will be created in "output/" and
trigger the upload rule (which should be modified depending on how you
publish).

Generally you would only have the Makefile, diary.rst and diary.cfg
files in a repo.
